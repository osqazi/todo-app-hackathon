# Tasks: Full-Stack Web Todo Application

**Feature**: `002-fullstack-web-app` | **Date**: 2025-12-29
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-fullstack-web-app/`
**Plan**: [plan.md](plan.md) | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md) | **Data Model**: [data-model.md](data-model.md) | **Contracts**: [contracts/](contracts/)
**Hackathon Phase**: Phase II

**Tests**: Per Constitution, test specifications are defined before implementation. Tests should be written first and FAIL before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story (US1-US5) - NO label for Setup/Foundational phases
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for both frontend and backend

- [ ] T002 Initialize FastAPI backend with pyproject.toml and dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, sqlmodel, python-jose, httpx)
- [ ] T003 Initialize Next.js 16+ frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS in frontend/ directory
- [ ] T004 Configure frontend project structure (src/app, src/components, src/lib, src/hooks, src/context, src/types)
- [ ] T005 Create backend requirements.txt with all Python dependencies per quickstart.md
- [ ] T006 Create frontend package.json with all Node dependencies (next, react, better-auth, @tanstack/react-query)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

- [ ] T015 Create get_current_user dependency in backend/src/auth/dependencies.py (extracts user_id from verified JWT)

### Better Auth Configuration (Frontend)

- [ ] T016 Install better-auth and @better-auth/node packages in frontend
- [ ] T017 Create Better Auth configuration in frontend/src/lib/auth.ts (betterAuth with JWT plugin, EdDSA signing, issuer/audience)
- [ ] T018 Create Better Auth API route handler in frontend/src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts
- [ ] T019 Create auth client with JWT plugin in frontend/src/lib/auth-client.ts (createAuthClient with jwtClient)

### Environment Configuration

- [ ] T020 Create backend/.env with DATABASE_URL, BETTER_AUTH_JWKS_URL, BETTER_AUTH_ISSUER, API_AUDIENCE
- [ ] T021 Create frontend/.env.local with NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL, DATABASE_URL, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if team capacity allows)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 but builds on same foundation
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses same task model as US2
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses same task model as US2/US3
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - UI/UX improvements only

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Contract test for GET /api/tasks in backend/tests/contract/test_tasks.py"
Task: "Contract test for POST /api/tasks in backend/tests/contract/test_tasks.py"
Task: "Integration test for task creation and listing in backend/tests/integration/test_tasks.py"

# Launch all schema tasks for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Create TaskCreate Pydantic schema in backend/src/schemas/task.py"
Task: "Create TaskResponse Pydantic schema in backend/src/schemas/task.py"
Task: "Create TaskUpdate Pydantic schema in backend/src/schemas/task.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently (signup, signin, signout)
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Authentication)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Create/View Tasks)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Update/Delete Tasks) + User Story 4 (Toggle)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. User Story 5 (Responsive) can be done by anyone throughout

## Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Tasks** | 86 |
| **Setup Phase** | 6 tasks |
| **Foundational Phase** | 15 tasks |
| **User Story 1 (P1)** | 10 tasks |
| **User Story 2 (P2)** | 16 tasks |
| **User Story 3 (P3)** | 12 tasks |
| **User Story 4 (P4)** | 9 tasks |
| **User Story 5 (P5)** | 8 tasks |
| **Polish Phase** | 10 tasks |

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 1: All 6 tasks can run in parallel
- Phase 2: ~10 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Each User Story: Multiple tasks marked [P] within story
- All User Stories: Can run in parallel after Foundational complete

### Independent Test Criteria

- **US1**: User can signup, signin, signout with persistent sessions
- **US2**: User can create tasks and view list (data persists after refresh)
- **US3**: User can update and delete own tasks (changes persist)
- **US4**: User can toggle completion status (visual feedback, persists)
- **US5**: Application works on mobile/tablet/desktop

### Suggested MVP Scope

**User Story 1 (P1) - Authentication** is the MVP:
- Without authentication, no multi-user isolation possible
- All other stories depend on authenticated users
- First deliverable: Working signup/signin flow

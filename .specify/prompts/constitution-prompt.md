# Todo In-Memory Python Console App Constitution

## Core Principles

### Basic Level Feature Implementation
Implement all 5 Basic Level features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete) with full functionality; All features must work reliably in the console application

### Spec-Driven Development Methodology
Use spec-driven development methodology with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus integration; Follow clean code principles and maintain proper Python project structure throughout development

### In-Memory State Management
Ensure the application stores tasks in memory with persistent state management during runtime; All task data must be stored in-memory (no persistent storage between runs)

### Comprehensive Error Handling
Include comprehensive error handling and input validation for all operations; Validate all user inputs and provide appropriate error messages

### Python Best Practices
Utilize UV package manager and Python 3.13+ for the technology stack; Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines and maintain consistent code formatting

### Cross-Platform Console Compatibility
Ensure cross-platform compatibility for the console application; The application must be command-line driven with clear user interface

## Technology Constraints
All features must be implemented using the specified technology stack (UV, Python 3.13+, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus); The project structure must follow Python best practices with proper module organization

## Success Criteria
Successfully implement all 5 basic features: Add, Delete, Update, View, and Mark Complete functionality; Deliver a working console application that meets all specified requirements and demonstrates proper functionality

## Governance
All development must follow spec-driven development practices; Constitution must be updated when project requirements change; All code changes must align with stated principles

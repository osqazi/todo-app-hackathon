## Prompt

/sp.constitution

[User provided comprehensive hackathon constitution markdown covering all 5 phases]

Project: The Evolution of Todo – A 5-Phase Journey from In-Memory Console App to Cloud-Native AI-Powered Chatbot

Core Principles: Spec-First Mindset, Zero Manual Coding, Progressive Evolution, Reusability and Intelligence, Production-Grade Quality

## Response snapshot

Successfully created comprehensive multi-phase hackathon constitution (v2.0.0):

**Constitution Transformation** (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0):
- Scope: Single Phase I console app → Complete 5-phase hackathon journey
- Duration: Single phase → Jan 18, 2026 deadline
- Complexity: Basic console → Cloud-native AI chatbot with K8s deployment

**Core Principles Established**:
1. **Spec-First Mindset**: No code generation without complete validated spec in `/specs/`
2. **Zero Manual Coding**: ≥95% code generated by Claude Code with evidence in git history
3. **Progressive Evolution**: Each phase builds on previous; no breaking changes or rewrites
4. **Reusability and Intelligence**: Create reusable skills/subagents across phases
5. **Production-Grade Quality**: Real-world standards with error handling, security, observability

**Key Standards Defined**:
- Specification Quality: Technology-agnostic, WHAT/WHY focus, complete acceptance criteria
- Code Generation Process: Iterative refinement documented in spec history
- Project Structure: Monorepo with frontend/, backend/, CLAUDE.md, /specs/ hierarchy
- Testing: Required for all phases; test specs before implementation
- Documentation: README + CLAUDE.md with setup/run/prompting strategy
- Security: Auth + JWT + data isolation (Phase II+)
- Deployment: Docker/K8s/Helm manifests (Phase IV-V)

**Technology Stack per Phase**:
- Phase I: Python 3.13+, UV, in-memory
- Phase II: FastAPI/SQLModel/Neon + Next.js 16+/Better Auth
- Phase III: OpenAI Agents SDK, streaming chat
- Phase IV: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Minikube
- Phase V: DigitalOcean DOKS, production monitoring

**Success Criteria**:
- ≥95% code generated by Claude Code
- All phases complete by Jan 18, 2026
- Live demo: console → web → chatbot → local K8s → cloud
- ≥1 bonus feature (Reusable Intelligence or Cloud-Native Blueprints)
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Judges can setup in <15 minutes

**Template Updates**:
- spec-template.md: Added Hackathon Phase field and constitution reminder
- plan-template.md: Added 14-point Hackathon Constitution Compliance checklist
- tasks-template.md: Added phase field, made tests required, added compliance notes

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution upgraded from single-phase to comprehensive 5-phase hackathon governance with spec-driven, zero-manual-coding, and progressive evolution principles
- 🧪 Tests: None (constitution document)
- 📁 Files: Updated constitution.md (v2.0.0) and 3 templates (spec/plan/tasks) with hackathon compliance requirements
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to create Phase II specification with new constitution constraints
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution now enforces production-grade quality across entire hackathon journey; templates provide clear compliance checkpoints; git history requirements ensure traceability; zero manual coding principle maintains spec-driven purity

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (constitution document)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Complete constitution replacement (not incremental update)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create Phase II spec under new constitution to validate compliance mechanisms work correctly
